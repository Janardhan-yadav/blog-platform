## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google-oauth-client-id>  # Optional
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend will run at: `http://localhost:5000`

**Endpoints Overview:**

* `POST /auth/signup` – Sign up
* `POST /auth/login` – Log in
* `GET /posts` – Get all posts
* `GET /posts/:id` – Get single post
* `POST /posts` – Create post (auth required)
* `PUT /posts/:id` – Edit post (auth & owner only)
* `DELETE /posts/:id` – Delete post (auth & owner only)
* `POST /posts/:id/like` – Like/Unlike a post
* `POST /posts/:id/bookmark` – Bookmark a post

---

### Web Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Web app will run at: `http://localhost:3000`

**Notes:**

* Uses Redux Toolkit for state management
* SCSS used for modular styling
* Supports SEO meta tags and Open Graph for blog posts

---

## AI Usage in Development

AI tools were used in the following areas:

* **Content suggestions:** Integrated ChatGPT API to provide AI-based suggestions while drafting blog posts.
* **Code scaffolding & debugging:** Copilot/ChatGPT helped in generating Redux slices, API calls, and React components.
* **UI/UX design:** AI-assisted design recommendations for responsive components and user flows.

**Prompting Technique Example:**

* *Prompt:* “Generate a Redux Toolkit slice for managing blog posts with actions for fetch, create, update, delete.”
* *Output:* Copilot generated the slice; modified to match project backend API and type definitions.

## Deployment

* **Web Frontend:** Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* **Backend API:** Hosted on [Render](https://render.com/)

**Environment Variables for Deployment:**

* `MONGO_URI` → MongoDB Atlas connection
* `JWT_SECRET` → Same as local dev
* `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` → Optional

---

## Security & Best Practices

* Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
* JWT used for authentication & session management
* Role-based access for editing/deleting posts
* API validation using `express-validator`

---

## Challenges Faced

1. Integrating JWT authentication across web consistently
2. Handling image uploads for blog posts
3. Keeping Redux state in sync with backend
4. AI-assisted content suggestions required fine-tuning prompts

---

## Bonus Features Implemented

* Search posts by title and tags
* Likes and bookmarks
* Pagination on home feed
* Rich text editor (React Quill)
* AI content suggestions
* SEO-compliant meta tags

If you want, I can **also make a ready-to-paste `.env.example` and folder structure guide** so you can directly push this to GitHub and run locally.  

Do you want me to do that next?
